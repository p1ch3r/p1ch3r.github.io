      Ecuador is a South American country whose capital city is Quito. The country derives its name from the equator which passes through the country. Ecuador is divided into 24 administrative provinces within which some of Ecuadorâ€™s biggest cities are located. Most of the population of Ecuador is concentrated in the urban towns and cities where they access employment opportunities from the industries and businesses running in these cities. Since the country was colonized by the Spanish, most of her towns and cities were established during this period and continue to serve most of their original functions.
