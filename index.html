      Cuenca, "The Most Developed City"
    </h1>
    <h1 id = "second">
     Cuenca, in the highlands of Ecuador, is the third largest and populous city in Ecuador with a population of 329,928 and the capital of Azuay Province. Archaeological evidence show settlement in the present day city existed around 8060BC with the population primarily engaging in cultivation and made ceramics. Cuenca was colonized by the Spanish who founded it in 1557. Cuenca is an important historical center due to its unique 17th and 18th-century Spanish architecture as well as archaeological materials collected from the dwellings of the earlier inhabitants. The city serves as educational, administrative, transport, and cultural functions. The cityâ€™s surroundings include the rural area of Molleturo, the Andes ranges, and El Cajas national park with rivers, streams, and lagoons.

     "Ecuador's Athens"

    <p class = "wonder">
      Most tourists visit the historic area, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, between the river Tomebamba and the street Gran Colombia to the north, General Torres to the west, and Hermano Miguel to the east. This area's compactness, grid-like layout, and numerous readily identifiable monuments make it easy to navigate. Outside this area the city can be confusing, as there are dozens of narrow colonial streets with similar buildings.
